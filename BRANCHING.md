# Branching

## What is branching?
If you think what we did in [Basics](https://github.com/zunction/learn-git/blob/master/BASICS.md) is all what Git is all about, then you are so wrong :joy:. Here is where we shall learn about the main selling point of Git, which is its version control capabilities. What do I mean by version control? Suppose you are working on writing `mycode.py` and you are very pleased with it. But after reading some papers or from some other references, you decide that you want to implement your code in a more efficient manner, then perhaps you will make a copy of `mycode.py` and rename it `mycode1.py`, after which for anything new you add to your code you will have `mycode2.py`, `mycode3.py`, ... Eventually you will forget what changes are made to which versions and you become frustrated, either from **having too many versions of your file** or **deleting the wrong version and emptying you recycling bin** :scream:
